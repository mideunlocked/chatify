    <h1>Privacy Policy for Chatify Messaging App</h1>

    <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use the Chatify messaging app ("App") developed with Flutter and Firebase. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as described in this Policy. If you do not agree with this Policy, please refrain from using the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Usage:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>a. Personal Information: The Chatify App does not collect or store any personally identifiable information about its users. The App only requires basic permissions necessary for its functionality, such as access to network connections and device storage.</li>
        <li>b. Messages and Media: The App securely encrypts your messages and media files with end-to-end encryption. The encryption ensures that only you and the intended recipient can access the content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Data Security:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>a. End-to-End Encryption: The Chatify App employs advanced encryption protocols to secure your conversations. This means that your messages and media files are encrypted on your device and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient's device.</li>
        <li>b. Encryption Keys: The App does not store or have access to your private encryption keys, ensuring that your data remains confidential.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Retention:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>a. The Chatify App does not store your messages or media files on any external servers or databases.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>a. The App may integrate with third-party services, such as Firebase, for the purpose of providing messaging functionality. These third-party services may have their own privacy policies, and you are encouraged to review them separately.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>a. The Chatify App is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
